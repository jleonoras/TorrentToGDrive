## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Google Colab Policies

It's important to understand that using this tool for torrenting **may violate Google Colab's Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy**.

* **Prohibited Uses**: Google's policies often prohibit peer-to-peer file-sharing. Running a torrent client falls into this category.
* **Resource Limits**: Colab environments are not intended for long-running, high-bandwidth processes. Continuous seeding or downloading large files can lead to your session being terminated.
* **Illegal Activity**: Downloading copyrighted material without permission is illegal and strictly against Google's terms.

**Use at Your Own Risk.** You are solely responsible for your activity on Google Colab. Misuse can lead to being temporarily or permanently blocked from the service. This tool is provided for educational and experimental purposes only.
